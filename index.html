<p>It's nothing much; just a beat with a piano. I wasn't inspired by anyone, it was just an assignment we had to
  complete.</p>

<p>In my freetime, I like to play sports. In high school I mainly played basektball and softball. I thought about
  playing softball in college, but decided not to. I have a twin brother who also goes to GCU and he is also very
  athletic. He played basketball and baseball in high school.</p>
